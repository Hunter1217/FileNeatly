# FileNeatly

## What is FileNeatly?
FileNeatly is a file organization app that can automatically sort pre-exisiting files, or sort new ones coming in. It can create new folders for the user and put the files inside these folders depending on what they are.

##  Why does it exist?
It does this to take the tedious tasks of navigating file systems and solving this by organizing it into simple yet descriptive spots.

## Key Features
- Automatically sort existing files
- Sort selected files into respective spots
- keep a log of items moved and where they are moved to
- revert changes
- create new folders and rename files (if necessary)
- can delete unnecessary files (duplicates, start up executables, etc.)

## How it works (high-level)
- Will parse through different directories, and send these through an MCP which will then designate specific files to folders. Select what you want done, or automatically do it, and it will deliver these files to the MCP for apraisal. The MCP will
  then assign these files to folders and move them to their respective folders. There is a revert option or a change option and a log option to see everything that was done and where it was sent. Has adjustable settings for more specific options
  available to the user.
