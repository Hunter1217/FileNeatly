# FileNeatly – Overview

## Problem statement
I have trouble keeping up with my files going in and out and it is constantly a mess. I want a simple solution to this problem that will take the load off of me. This application is that solution,
It will automatically sort things in various directories and makes sure everything is in order and logged for tracking specific files.

## Target users
This is for any user who wishes to not have to worry about sorting files and file navigation ever again. It can be used for companies as well to organize files in large systems. This is not for
people who do not hold information on their computers or temporary computers where file navigation is not needed.

## Core concepts
(How FileNeatly thinks about files)

## Organization logic
(Rules, heuristics, AI role)

## Non-goals
The product does not delete files without permission, and does not rename files without permission. It will not move things to where they are unfindable, and you are able to search the database
to see where it was put.
